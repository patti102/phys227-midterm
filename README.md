## Description



## My Thoughts on the Midterm



## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

I used the README and Travis linking files in my other homework repositories as a template for this one.

Signed,
Taylor Patti

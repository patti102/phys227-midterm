## Description

We got to play with chaos here, as well as its precursors. First we generated and plotted simple fixed points, two cycles, and the like. Then, we approached the boarder of chaos by augmenting the growth parameter above the oscillatory threshhold. Finally, we generated a late time logistic map diagram that illustrated how chaos evolves, and even at some points momentarily devolves, for high value growth rate parameters.


## My Thoughts on the Midterm

This was super cool. Everybody loves chaos. This is the most fun thing we've done so far, although it was not the most challenging. The best part about it was that this is physics for which you absolutely need computation. Quantum stuff with no closed-form solution would also be cool, if we happen to get the chance.


## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

I used the README and Travis linking files in my other homework repositories as a template for this one. I also got out my old Classical Mechanics textbook and read some of the chaos stuff. Although, this was mostly for amusement and didn't relate very directly to the assignment.

Signed,
Taylor Patti
